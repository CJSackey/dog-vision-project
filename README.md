End-toEnd multiclass Dog Breed Classification Project.

This notebook builds and end-to-end multiclass image classifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensoFlow Hub.

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given the image.

2. Data
From Kaggle's Dog Breed Data Evaluation Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data

3. Evaluation
For each image in the test set, we must predict a probability for each of the different breeds. The file should contain a header and have the following format in the link below:

4. Features
Some information:

We're dealing with images (unstructured data) therefore Deep Learning or Transfer Learning is preferable
There are 120 breeds of dogs (120 different classes).
There are around 10,000 images in the training set (these images have lables).
There are around 10,000 images in the the test set (these images have no labels).
